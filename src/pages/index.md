  title: Why AfCFTA
  description: >-
    The AfCFTA is the African continent’s most ambitious integration initiative,
    embedded in the Agenda 2063 of the African Union, whose main objective is to
    create a single continental market for goods and services with free movement
    of people and investments, thus expanding intra-African trade across the
    continent, enhancing competitiveness and supporting economic transformation
    in Africa.
            The AfCFTA is expected to increase intra-Africa trade from an existing level of about 13% to 25% or more through better harmonisation and coordination of trade liberalisation. This will be driven forward by the complementary Single African Air Transport Market and the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons.
description: "The African Union's 18th Ordinary Session of Heads of State and
  Government, convened in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in January 2012, decided to
  construct a Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) by an estimated date of 2017.
  The Summit also supported the BIAT (Balancing Intra-Africa Trade) Action Plan,
  which contains seven clusters: trade policy, trade facilitation, productive
  capacity, and market access, The CFTA will bring together fifty-four African
  countries with a combined population of over one billion people and a combined
  GDP of more than $3.4 trillion dollars."
